      <p>
      Speech and Communication disorders are common in people with
cerebral palsy. Due to restricted movement in oral-facial muscles,
oral-articulation becomes difficult. It becomes important to have an
alternative mode of language. Handwritten notes, with pre-decided quotes,
play the role of passive communicators, initiating little communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>SayIt</i> tries to solve this problem by building a cross-platform mobile application to
assist the specially abled. The application provides for two different modes of assistance with Speech
capabilities. The application is built to help the people, who assist the
disabled, in building their own personal notes and sharing them.
